Create a step-by-step guide for writing and executing a "Hello World" program using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Step 1: Install Python
Before you start, ensure Python is installed on your system:
1. Download Python:
   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download the latest version of Python for Windows.

2. Install Python:
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - **Important:** Check the box labeled "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now."
   - Complete the installation process by following the prompts.


Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
If you donâ€™t have VS Code installed:

1. Download VS Code:
   - Go to the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Download the installer for Windows.

2. Install VS Code:
   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to install VS Code on your system.


Step 3: Install the Python Extension for VS Code

1. Open VS Code:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code from your Start menu or desktop shortcut.

2. Open Extensions View:
   - Click on the Extensions view icon in the Sidebar (or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`).

3. Search for Python Extension:
   - Type "Python" in the search bar and select the Python extension provided by Microsoft from the search results.

4. Install the Extension:
   - Click the `Install` button to add the Python extension to VS Code.


Step 4: Create and Write the "Hello World" Program

1. Open a New File:
   - Go to `File` > `New File` (or press `Ctrl + N`).

2. Write the Code:
   - Type the following Python code in the new file:
     print("Hello, World!")
   - This code prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

3. Save the File:
   - Go to `File` > `Save As...` (or press `Ctrl + S`).
   - In the Save As dialog:
     - Select Location: Choose a directory where you want to save the file, such as `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents`.
     - File Name: Enter `hello.py` (make sure the file extension is `.py`).
     - Save as Type: Ensure it is set to `All Files` (not `Text Documents`).
   - Click `Save`.


Step 5: Run the Python Program

1. Open the Terminal in VS Code:
   - Go to `Terminal` > `New Terminal` (or press `Ctrl + ` `).

2. Navigate to Your File Directory (if needed):
   - If your terminal does not start in the directory where `hello.py` is saved, use the `cd` command to navigate to the correct directory. For example:
     cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
   - Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username.

3. Run the Python Program:
   - In the terminal, type the following command and press `Enter`:
     python hello.py
   - Alternatively, if your Python executable is named differently (e.g., `python3`), use that command:
     python3 hello.py

4. View the Output:
   - You should see the output:
     Hello, World!
