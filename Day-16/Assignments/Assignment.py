# Basic Operators
'''
Create two variables num1 and num2 with values 10 and 5 respectively.

Perform the following operations:
    Addition: Add num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable named add_result.
    Subtraction: Subtract num2 from num1 and store the result in a variable named sub_result.
    Multiplication: Multiply num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable named mul_result.
    Division: Divide num1 by num2 and store the result in a variable named div_result.
    Exponentiation: Raise num1 to the power of num2 and store the result in a variable named exp_result.

Print the results of all the operations.
